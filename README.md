# Noa Technologies | Code challenge for frontend engineers (React.ts)

This is a brief evaluation task to assess level of applicants to Noa
Technologies frontend engineering positions.

## Our goals

We would like to evaluate your general React coding skills, along with other
skills that could prove very useful to us.

- typescript fluency
- code organisation and tidyness
- geolocation and geographical applications context comprehension
- basic external library/api documentation comprehension
- UI design skills when UI design support is not available

## The task

Modify the existing app to match the following criteria.

- App uses these data
  - user ip using [ipify API](https://api.ipify.org/)
  - ip location and stats using [ipinfo geo API](https://ipinfo.io/)
  - user location from browser using
    [geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
- App has 2 pages, uses react router for navigation, with a simple nav placed in
  a fixed position above the page and always visible
  - fullscreen map
    - uses [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
    - shows marker with current user location
    - shows marker with user ip location
    - shows a line between the two with a distance annotation
  - ip stats
    - shows user location coordinates and gps accuracy
    - shows user ip data collected from ipinfo
- App should build correctly for production

### Constraints

You should be able to follow this general rules.

- Don't intall any external package, everything you need should already be here.
  If you think that's really mandatory, comment the stuff explaining your
  decision
- Avoid using classes
- Data from web api should be fetched just once when page loads
- Only one user location subscriber should be active at any time
- App should be responsive to every screen size/shape

### Estimated time for completion

This depends on your base skill, probably anything between 1 and 3 hours.
